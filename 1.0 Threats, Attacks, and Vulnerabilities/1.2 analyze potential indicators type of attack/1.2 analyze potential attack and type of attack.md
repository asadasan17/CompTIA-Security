##malware
 Malware or malicious code is any element of software that performs an unwanted function from the perspective of the legitimate user or owner of a computer system.  It is essential that modifying user behavior to avoid risky activities be a core part of a malware security strategy.

    #Randsomware
        Ransomware is a form of malware that takes over a computer system, usually by encrypting user data, to hold data hostage while demanding payment. Ransomware is often sophisticated enough to be able to encrypt files on internal and external storage devices, network shares, and even cloud storage services. if you pay the ransom and receive an encryption key to regain access to your data files, there is no guarantee that this will remove the ransomware from your system.

        Ransomware may not always be immediately noticed by the user of a system. However, performing file encryption is a significant amount of work, so most systems will begin to act sluggishly or potentially even stop responding while the system’s central processing unit (CPU) and memory resources are consumed by the malicious encryption process.

        Symptoms ransomware infection
            1. inability to access data
            2. missing data
            3. system that will not boot
            4. sluggish system (during the encryption processes)
            5. pop-ups demanding payment to decrypt your data

        #Protect Randsomware
            1. avoiding risky behaviors example "Download pirated software"
            2. running advanced antimalware software
            3. maintaining a reliable backup of your data

    #Trojans
        A Trojan or Trojan horse is a means of delivering malicious software by disguising inside of a benign host file. Skilled malicious programmers can create custom Trojans by adding malicious code directly into the source code of the selected host. These tools hide or embed the malicious payload inside of the select benign host file

    #Worms
        Worms are self-contained applications that don’t require becoming attached directly to a host file or hard drive to infect a system. Worms typically are focused on replication and distribution (locally or across a network). Worms can also be designed as delivery mechanisms to drop off other types of malware.

        Symptoms worm infection
            1. slow-to-respond system
            2. applications that no longer will execute
            3. lack of free space on storage devices
            4. CPU and memory utilization maxed out at 100 percent
            5. system crashes
            6. abnormal network activity

    #PUA (Potential Unwanted Application)
        Potentially unwanted Application (PUA) are any type of questionable software, such as sniffers, password crackers, network mappers, port scanners, keystroke loggers, and vulnerability scanners. PUA could be used for an authorized legitimate purpose or for a malicious one.

    #Fileless virus
        Viruses are programs designed to spread from one system to another through self-replication and to perform any of a wide range of malicious activities. Some viruses replicate and spread so rapidly that they consume most of the available system.

        Virus have 2 types file virus(common virus)  and sector virus, sector viruses that attach themselves to the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of a storage device are known as boot sector viruses.

        malicious activities viruses
            1. data deletion
            2. corruption
            3. alteration
            4. exfiltration

        types of viruses
            1. polymorphic
            2. macro
            3. stealth
            4. armored
            5. retro
            6. phage
            7. companion
            8. multipart/multipartite

        Fileless viruses reside in memory only and do not save themselves to the local storage devices. They are injected into memory by either a file-based injector that then self-destructs or through a network to memory-writing event. This makes discovering them more challenging. Rebooting a system can potentially rid them from a system

        symptoms virus infection
            1. corrupted or missing data files
            2. applications that will no longer execute
            3. slow system operation
            4. lag between mouse click and system response
            5. application or system crashes
            6. ongoing hard drive activity
            7. system’s tendency to be unresponsive to mouse movements or keystrokes
            
    #C&C(Command and Control)
        Command and control (C&C) (a.k.a. C2, herder) is an intermediary serving as the locus of connection between an attacker and bots where commands are distributed and information is exchanged. C&C assists the attacker in remaining anonymous, while controlling botnet agents. 

        communication system used as C&C
            1. internet relay chat (IRC) channels
            2. IM
            3. Facebook accounts
            4. Twitter accounts
            5. file transfer protocol (FTP) sites
            6. email accounts
            7. telnet sites
            8. websites 
            9. (P2P, PTP) systems

    #Bots
         botnet is a shortened form of the phrase “software robot network”. describe a massive deployment of malicious code onto numerous compromised systems that are all remotely controlled by a hacker. 

         bots commond know used 
            1. DoS flooding attacks
            2. transmit spam
            3. password cracking
            4. other malicious activity

        Direct control of a botnet occurs when the bot herder sends commands to each bot.  bots have a listening service on an open port waiting for the communication from the bot herder.  botnet creator writes their botnet code to exploit a common and widespread vulnerability to spread the botnet agent far and wide. This botnet infection code is often called a botnet agent, bot, or zombie.

        Defence again botnets 
            1. keep your systems patched and hardened
            2. not become the host of a botnet agent
            3. Strict outbound firewall rules
            4. spoofed source address filtering
            5. web content filtering
            6. antivirus software and antispyware/adware tools

        Indicators of botnet
            1. slow system performance
            2. abnormal network traffic
            3. strange files appearing
            4. unknown processes
            5. odd program windows appearing on the desktop
            6. abnormal communications to external targets that are significantly large
        
        Botnet agents can be designed to infect any type 
            1. traditional PCs and servers
            2. printers
            3. routers
            4. firewalls
            5. wireless access points
            6. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
            7. security cameras
            8. mobile phones

    #Cryptomalware
        Cryptomalware  uses system resources to mine cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Monero.  Cryptomalware is often designed to remain hidden and give little hint of its presence on the system.

    #Logic Bombs
        A logic bomb is a form of malicious code that remains dormant until a triggering event or condition occurs.

        Triggering event 
            1. time & date 
            2. specific program 
            3. keystroge combination 
            4. state or condition 
            5. access specifict URL 

        Symptoms logic bomb
            1. abrupt change in system performance
            2. crashing of applications or the system
            3. loss of storage device free space

    #Spyware
        Spyware is any form of malicious code or even business/commercial code that collects information about users without their direct knowledge or permission.  Spyware can be deposited by malware, or it can be installed as an extra element of applications.

        + adware 
            Adware displays pop-up or alternate advertisements to users based on their activities. Some forms of adware display offerings for fake or false security products. They often display an animation that seems like the system is being scanned. This type of malware is also known as scareware or fake security software.

    #Keyloggers
        keylogger is a PUA that records keystrokes.  keylogger usually stores the collected keystrokes in a file, but some only hold data in memory until it is transmitted elsewhere

    #RAT (Remote Access Trojan)
         remote-access Trojan (RAT) is malware that grants an attacker some level of remotecontrol access to a compromised system.RATs are usually downloaded invisibly with a user-requested program -- such as a game -- or sent as an email attachment. 

         symptoms
            1. odd network communications and traffic levels
            2. system that will not auto-engage the screensaver or timed sleep mode
            3. higher levels of drive, CPU, and memory activity
            4. appearance of unknown files on storage devices

    #Rootkit
        rootkit is malware that embeds itself deep within an operating system (OS).  derivative of the concept of rooting and a utility kit of hacking tools. Rooting is gaining total or full control over a system.  rootkit often positions itself deep into the OS, where it can manipulate information seen by the OS and displayed to users.

        effect rootkit 
            1. replace the OS kernel
            2. shim itself under the kernel
            3. replace device drivers
            4. infiltrate application libraries
        
        once you suspect a rootkit is on a system, the only truly secure response is to reconstitute or replace the entire computer. Reconstitution  performing a thorough storage sanitization operation on all storage devices on that system, reinstalling the OS and all applications from trusted original sources, and then restoring files from trusted rootkit-free backups. Rootkit detection is difficult because a rootkit may be able to subvert the software that is intended to find it.

        Detection methods Rootkits
            1. using an alternative and trusted operating system
            2. behavioral-based methods
            3. signature scanning
            4. difference scanning
            5. memory dump analysis

        Removal can be complicated or practically impossible, especially in cases where the rootkit resides in the kernel; reinstallation of the operating system may be the only available solution to the problem. When dealing with firmware rootkits, removal may require hardware replacement, or specialized equipment.

    #Backdoor
        The term backdoor can refer to two types of problems or attacks on a system. 
            1. backdoor was a developer-installed access method that bypassed all security restrictions.
                backdoor was a special hard-coded user account, password, or command sequence that allowed anyone with knowledge of the access hook to enter the environment and make changes.
            2. backdoor is a hacker-installed remote-access remote-control malicious client.
                backdoor serves as an access portal for hackers so that they can bypass any security restrictions, authentication requirements, and gain (or regain) access to a system can be sent with malware, or intrusion activity.

##Password Attack
    Password-focused attacks are collectively known as password cracking or password guessing. Passwords are usually stored in a hashed format for the security provided by the one-way process. password hash does not contain the password characters, but it is a representation of the password produced by the hashing algorithm. Password hashes can be attacked using reverse engineering, reverse hash matching, or a birthday attack. 

    #Spraying
        Spraying passwords or credential stuffing is the attempt to log into a user account through repeated attempts of submitting generated or pulled-from-a-list credentials. Credential stuffing can be mitigated by sites themselves by implementing account lockout.

    #Dictionary
        dictionary attack (Figure 1.5) performs password guessing by using a preexisting or precompiled list of possible passwords.
