##malware
 Malware or malicious code is any element of software that performs an unwanted function from the perspective of the legitimate user or owner of a computer system.  It is essential that modifying user behavior to avoid risky activities be a core part of a malware security strategy.

    #Randsomware
        Ransomware is a form of malware that takes over a computer system, usually by encrypting user data, to hold data hostage while demanding payment. Ransomware is often sophisticated enough to be able to encrypt files on internal and external storage devices, network shares, and even cloud storage services. if you pay the ransom and receive an encryption key to regain access to your data files, there is no guarantee that this will remove the ransomware from your system.

        Ransomware may not always be immediately noticed by the user of a system. However, performing file encryption is a significant amount of work, so most systems will begin to act sluggishly or potentially even stop responding while the system’s central processing unit (CPU) and memory resources are consumed by the malicious encryption process.

        Symptoms ransomware infection
            1. inability to access data
            2. missing data
            3. system that will not boot
            4. sluggish system (during the encryption processes)
            5. pop-ups demanding payment to decrypt your data

        #Protect Randsomware
            1. avoiding risky behaviors example "Download pirated software"
            2. running advanced antimalware software
            3. maintaining a reliable backup of your data

    #Trojans
        A Trojan or Trojan horse is a means of delivering malicious software by disguising inside of a benign host file. Skilled malicious programmers can create custom Trojans by adding malicious code directly into the source code of the selected host. These tools hide or embed the malicious payload inside of the select benign host file

    #Worms
        Worms are self-contained applications that don’t require becoming attached directly to a host file or hard drive to infect a system. Worms typically are focused on replication and distribution (locally or across a network). Worms can also be designed as delivery mechanisms to drop off other types of malware.

        Symptoms worm infection
            1. slow-to-respond system
            2. applications that no longer will execute
            3. lack of free space on storage devices
            4. CPU and memory utilization maxed out at 100 percent
            5. system crashes
            6. abnormal network activity

    #PUA (Potential Unwanted Application)
        Potentially unwanted Application (PUA) are any type of questionable software, such as sniffers, password crackers, network mappers, port scanners, keystroke loggers, and vulnerability scanners. PUA could be used for an authorized legitimate purpose or for a malicious one.

    #Fileless virus
        Viruses are programs designed to spread from one system to another through self-replication and to perform any of a wide range of malicious activities. Some viruses replicate and spread so rapidly that they consume most of the available system.

        Virus have 2 types file virus(common virus)  and sector virus, sector viruses that attach themselves to the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of a storage device are known as boot sector viruses.

        malicious activities viruses
            1. data deletion
            2. corruption
            3. alteration
            4. exfiltration

        types of viruses
            1. polymorphic
            2. macro
            3. stealth
            4. armored
            5. retro
            6. phage
            7. companion
            8. multipart/multipartite

        Fileless viruses reside in memory only and do not save themselves to the local storage devices. They are injected into memory by either a file-based injector that then self-destructs or through a network to memory-writing event. This makes discovering them more challenging. Rebooting a system can potentially rid them from a system

        symptoms virus infection
            1. corrupted or missing data files
            2. applications that will no longer execute
            3. slow system operation
            4. lag between mouse click and system response
            5. application or system crashes
            6. ongoing hard drive activity
            7. system’s tendency to be unresponsive to mouse movements or keystrokes
            
    #C&C(Command and Control)
        Command and control (C&C) (a.k.a. C2, herder) is an intermediary serving as the locus of connection between an attacker and bots where commands are distributed and information is exchanged. C&C assists the attacker in remaining anonymous, while controlling botnet agents. 

        communication system used as C&C
            1. internet relay chat (IRC) channels
            2. IM
            3. Facebook accounts
            4. Twitter accounts
            5. file transfer protocol (FTP) sites
            6. email accounts
            7. telnet sites
            8. websites 
            9. (P2P, PTP) systems

    #Bots
         botnet is a shortened form of the phrase “software robot network”. describe a massive deployment of malicious code onto numerous compromised systems that are all remotely controlled by a hacker. 

         bots commond know used 
            1. DoS flooding attacks
            2. transmit spam
            3. password cracking
            4. other malicious activity

        Direct control of a botnet occurs when the bot herder sends commands to each bot.  bots have a listening service on an open port waiting for the communication from the bot herder.  botnet creator writes their botnet code to exploit a common and widespread vulnerability to spread the botnet agent far and wide. This botnet infection code is often called a botnet agent, bot, or zombie.

        Defence again botnets 
            1. keep your systems patched and hardened
            2. not become the host of a botnet agent
            3. Strict outbound firewall rules
            4. spoofed source address filtering
            5. web content filtering
            6. antivirus software and antispyware/adware tools

        Indicators of botnet
            1. slow system performance
            2. abnormal network traffic
            3. strange files appearing
            4. unknown processes
            5. odd program windows appearing on the desktop
            6. abnormal communications to external targets that are significantly large
        
        Botnet agents can be designed to infect any type 
            1. traditional PCs and servers
            2. printers
            3. routers
            4. firewalls
            5. wireless access points
            6. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
            7. security cameras
            8. mobile phones

    #Cryptomalware
        Cryptomalware  uses system resources to mine cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Monero.  Cryptomalware is often designed to remain hidden and give little hint of its presence on the system.

    #Logic Bombs
        A logic bomb is a form of malicious code that remains dormant until a triggering event or condition occurs.

        Triggering event 
            1. time & date 
            2. specific program 
            3. keystroge combination 
            4. state or condition 
            5. access specifict URL 

        Symptoms logic bomb
            1. abrupt change in system performance
            2. crashing of applications or the system
            3. loss of storage device free space
