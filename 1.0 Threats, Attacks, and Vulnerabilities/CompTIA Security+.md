##1.1 Type Sosial Engineering

	#Phising
	Phishing is the process of attempting to obtain sensitive information in electronic communications. Phishing used for obtain sensitive, confidential, or private information.  Phishing can be waged using any communication means using Email, SMS, Telphon. There some kind type of Phising : 

        + Email Phishing 
            1. Most phishing messages are delivered by email spam, and are not personalized or targeted to a specific individual or company
            2. common targets for impersonation include banks and financial services, email and cloud productivity providers, and streaming services.
            3. Attackers may use the credentials obtained to directly steal money from a victim, although compromised accounts are often used instead as a jumping-off point to perform other attacks, such as the theft of proprietary information, the installation of malware, or the spear phishing of other people within the target's organization

        + Spear Phishing
            1. Spear phishing attack directly targeting a specific organization or person with tailored phishing communications
            2. creation and sending  emails to a particular person to make the person think the email is legitimate. example targeted is executives or those that work in financial departments that have access to the organization's sensitive financial data and services
            3. attackers gather and use personal information about their target to increase their probability of success of the attack

        + Whaling
            1. Whaling refers to spear phishing attacks directed specifically at senior executives and other high-profile targets
            2. goal of whaling attack is to steal credentials from the high-level target or to use that target to steal funds or redirect resources to the benefit of the attacker
            3. attacker sends malicious communications to a CEO that are sometimes crafted to seem like they come from an employee or a trusted outside

        + Vishing
            1. Vishing is phishing done over any telephony or voice communication system, including Telephone, VoIP, Mobile phone.
            2. Attackers will dial a large quantity of telephone numbers and play automated recordings that make false claims of fraudulent activity on the victim's bank accounts or credit cards.
            3. The calling phone number will be spoofed to show the real number of the bank or institution impersonated 
            4. Then the victim directed call a number of attackers, which will automatically prompt them to enter sensitive information in order to "resolve" the supposed fraud

        + Smishing
            1. Attackers use mobile phone text messages to deliver the "bait"
            2. Smishing attacks typically invite the user to click a link, call a phone number, or contact an email address provided by the attacker via SMS message

        + Pharming
            1. Pharming is the malicious redirection of a valid website’s URL or IP address to a fake website that hosts a false version of the original(valid site).
            2. false target is often crafted to look and operate similar enough to the legitimate one to fool the victim

        + Spoofing 
            Spoofing is any action to hide a valid identity often by taking on the identity ofsomething else . spoofing using media email, mobile telpon, website, or using Network Protocols  Such as ARP(Address Resolution Protocols), DNS(Domain Name System).

        + SPAM
            Spam is any type of email that is undesired and/or unsolicited
            1. Some spam carries malicious code such as viruses, logic bombs, ransomware, or Trojan horses
            2. Some spam carries social engineering attacks (also known as hoax messages)
            3. Unwanted email wastes your time while you sort through it looking for legitimate messages
            4. Spam wastes Internet resources: storage capacity, computing cycles, and throughput

        + Protect Phishing
            1. email filter & antivirus scanners
            2. Sender Policy Framework (SPF)
            3. Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)
            4. Domain Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC)

			
    # Typosquatting

        + Typosquatting
            1. Typosquatting is a type of social engineering attack which targets internet users who incorrectly type a URL into their web browser rather than using a search engine
            2. A squatter predicts URL typos and then registers those domain names to direct traffic to their own site
            3. The variations used for typosquatting include common misspellings (such as googel.com), typing errors (such as gooogle.com), variations on a name or word (for example, plurality, as in googles.com), and different top-level domains (TLDs) such as google.edu

        + URL hijacking
            1. displaying a link or advertisement that looks like that of a well-known product, service, or site, but when clicked redirects the user to an alternate location, service, or product
            2. This may be accomplished by posting sites and pages and exploiting search engine optimization (SEO), or through the use of adware that replaces legitimate ads and links with those leading to alternate or malicious locations

        + Clickjacking
            1. redirect a user’s click or selection on a web page to an alternate often malicious target instead of the intended and desired location
            2. One means of clickjacking is to add an invisible or hidden overlay, frame, or image map over the displayed page

    # Pretexting
        1. Pretexting is a certain type of social engineering technique that manipulates victims into divulging information
        2. During pretexting attacks, threat actors typically ask victims for certain information, stating that it is needed to confirm the victim’s identity
        3. Pretexters use a variety of tactics and techniques to gain the trust of their targets and convince them to hand over valuable information, example Impresonation, Phising, Vishing, Smishing, Tailgating, Baiting. 
    

    #Impresonation
        Impersonation is the act of taking on the identity of someone else to use their access or authority. 
            1. Impersonation can also be known as masquerading, spoofing, and even identity fraud. Impersonation can also be known as masquerading, spoofing, and even identity fraud.
            2. Defenses against physical location impersonation can include use of access badges, security guards, and requiring the presentation and verification of identification (ID)
        
        + Identity Fraud 
            Identity fraud is the use by one person of another person's personal information, without authorization, to commit a crime or to deceive or defraud that other person or a third person.
            1. Personal Information Fraud
            2. Credit card Fraud
            3. Bank Fraud
            4. Loan Fraud
            

    #Dumpster Diving 
        Dumpster diving is the act of digging through trash, discarded equipment, or abandoned locations to obtain information about a target organization or individual. 

        + Prevent Dumpster Diving 
            1. all documents should be shredded and/or incinerated before being discarded
            2. Secure storage media disposal often includes incineration, shredding, or chipping

     #Shoulder Surfing
        Shoulder surfing occurs when someone is able to watch a user’s keyboard or view their display. 

        + Shoulder Surfing Defence 
            1. dividing worker groups by sensitivity levels an limiting access to certain areas of the building using locked doors
            2. Users should not work on sensitive data while in a public space
            3. use screen filters restricts viewing angle

    #Tailgating 
        Tailgating occurs when an unauthorized entity gains access to a facility under the authorization of a valid worker but without their knowledge. 
            1. attacker may be able to sneak in behind a valid worker before the door closes 
            2. Problem similar to tailgating is piggybacking, Piggybacking occurs when an unauthorized entity gains access to a facility under the authorization of a valid worker by tricking the victim into providing consent

        + Protect again tailgating method 
            1. Should ensure that it is closed and locked before walking away
            2. Company policy should be focused on changing user behavior toward more security
            3. Implemented access control vestibules, security cameras, and security guards

    #Reconnaissance
        Reconnaissance is collecting information about a target, often for the purposes of planning an attack against that target.

    #Hoaxes 
        A hoax is a form of social engineering designed to convince targets to perform an action that will cause harm or reduce their IT security

        1. Victims may be instructed to delete files, change configuration settings, or install fraudulent security software
        2. A hoax often presents a threat and then provides or suggests a response or solution, while claiming taking no action will result in harm
        
        + Protect again hoax 
            1. Whenever you encounter a potential hoax or just are concerned that a claimed threat is real, do the research
            2. If a threat is real, it will be widely discussed and confirmed
            3. great places to check for hoax information is snopes.com and phishtank.com.

    #Watering Hole Attacks 
        A watering hole attack is a form of targeted attack against a region, a group, or an organization. The attacker observes the target’s habits to discover a common resource that one or more members of the target frequent.

        1. target’s habits location web access is considered the watering hole
        2. Malware is planted on the watering hole system
        3. The target visits the poisoned watering hole, and they bring the infection back into the group or at least their system

    #Influence Campaings
        Influence campaigns are social engineering attacks that attempt to guide, adjust, or change public opinion. Most influence campaigns seem to be waged by nation-states against their real or perceived foreign enemies.

        1. Influence campaigns are linked to the distribution of disinformation, propaganda, false information, “fake news,” and even the activity of doxing
        2. Misleading, incomplete, crafted, and altered information can be used as part of an influence campaign to adjust the perception of readers and viewers to the concepts, thoughts, and ideologies of the influencer.
        3. Doxing is the collection of information about an individual or an organization (which can also include governments and the military) to disclose the collected data publicly for purpose of changing opinions.


    #Principles Social Engineering 
        Social engineering works so well because we’re human. The principles of social engineering attacks are designed to focus on various aspects of human nature and take advantage of them.
        1. Authority
            + Authority is an effective technique because most people are likely to respond to authority with obedience
            + The trick is to convince the target that the attacker is someone with valid authority
            + That authority can be from within an organization’s internal hierarchy or from an external recognized authority, such as law enforcement, technical support, etc

        2. Intimidation
            + Intimidation can sometimes be seen as a derivative of the authority principle
            + Intimidation uses authority, confidence, or even the threat of harm to motivate someone to follow ordersor instructions
            + Intimidation is focused on exploiting uncertainty in a situation where a clear directive of operation or response isn’t defined
            + The attacker attempts to use perceived or real force to bend the will of the victim before the victim has time to consider and respond with a denial

        3. Consensus
            + Consensus or social proof is the act of taking advantage of a person’s natural tendency to mimic what others are doing or are perceived as having done in the past
            
        4. Scarcity
            + Scarcity is a technique used to convince someone that an object has a higher value based on the object’s scarcity
            + This could relate to the existence of only a few items produced or limited opportunities or that the majority of stock has sold and only a few items remain

        5. Familiarity
            + Familiarity or liking as a social-engineering principle attempts to exploit a person’s native trust in that which is familiar
            + The attacker often tries to appear to have a common contact or relationship with the target, such as mutual friends or experiences, or uses a facade to take on the identity of another company or person
            + If the target believes a message is from a known entity, such as a friend or their bank, they’re much more likely to trust in the content and even act or respond.

        6. Trust
            + Trust as a social engineering principle involves an attacker working to develop a relationship with a victim
            + This may take seconds or months, but eventually the attacker attempts to use the value of the relationship (the victim’s trust in the attacker) to convince the victim to reveal information or perform an action that violates company security

        7. Urgency
            + Urgency often dovetails with scarcity, because the need to act quickly increases as scarcityindicates a greater risk of missing out
            + Urgency is often used as a method to get a quick response from a target before they have time to carefully consider or refuse compliance
