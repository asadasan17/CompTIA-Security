## Scenario and Analyze Application Attack 
    in this section we learn a variety attack and exploitations used attackers to exfiltrate data or logical/pyhsical access to target

    #Arbitrary Code Execution/Remote Code Execution
        arbitrary code execution (ACE) is an attacker's ability to run any commands or code of the attacker's choice on a target machine or in a target process. program that is designed to exploit such a vulnerability is called an arbitrary code execution exploit. The ability to trigger arbitrary code execution over a network (especially via a wide-area network such as the Internet).

    #Privilege Escalation
        Privilege escalation occurs when a user is able to obtain greater permissions, access, or privileges. Privilege escalation is a tactic employed by hackers who are attempting to obtain a broader range of permissions, access, and capabilities.
