## Scenario and Analyze Application Attack 
    in this section we learn a variety attack and exploitations used attackers to exfiltrate data or logical/pyhsical access to target

    #Arbitrary Code Execution/Remote Code Execution
        arbitrary code execution (ACE) is an attacker's ability to run any commands or code of the attacker's choice on a target machine or in a target process. program that is designed to exploit such a vulnerability is called an arbitrary code execution exploit. The ability to trigger arbitrary code execution over a network (especially via a wide-area network such as the Internet).

    #Privilege Escalation
        Privilege escalation occurs when a user is able to obtain greater permissions, access, or privileges. Privilege escalation is a tactic employed by hackers who are attempting to obtain a broader range of permissions, access, and capabilities.

        Privilege escalation can take place via weaknesses in the OS or an application. Often a hacker tool is used to exploit a programming flaw to obtain permanent or temporary access to a privileged group or account. Auditing and monitoring should be configured to watch for privilege-escalation symptoms. 
    
    
    #Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
        Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that can be found in some web applications. XSS attacks enable attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy.

        XSS attack impact
            1. identity theft
            2. credential theft
            3. personally identifiable information (PII) privacy violations
            4. data theft
            5. financial losses
            6. planting of remote-control software on visiting clients

        XSS Attack Type
            1. persistent XSS attack
                plants poisoned material on the website to be served to any future visitors. Most XSS attacks do not require that the victim authenticate to a website for harm to occur.
            2. reflective XSS attack
                places the malicious content in the request of the visitor, so the harmful response or result from the website is actually a reflection of the request. when a phishing email is sent to victims with a hyperlink that includes the malicious script.
            3. Direct object model (DOM)
                take advantage of vulnerabilities in the client-side browser rather than issues on the server side.  triggered DOM-based XSS performs all of the malicious actions within the clientâ€™s system without communicating with a web server.

        Defence again XSS Attack
            as administrator website 
                1. maintaining a patched web server
                2. using web application firewalls
                3. operating a host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS)
                4. auditing for suspicious activity
                5. performing serverside input validation for length, malicious content, and escaping or filtering metacharacters

            as web user 
                1. keeping your system patched
                2. running antivirus software
                3. avoiding non-mainstream websites

    #Injections 
        injection attack is any exploitation that allows an attacker to submit code to a target system to modify its operations and/or poison and corrupt its data set. injection attack is named after the type of backend system it takes advantage of or the type of payload delivered (injected) onto the target. 

        variations of injection attacks
            1. command
                command injection attack focuses on executing malicious commands on a vulnerable target system. This type of attack is possible when unsafand unfiltered data is passed from the vulnerable application to a system shell, terminal, or command prompt. to protect command injection (Proper input sanitization, filtering, and validation would generally eliminate this risk).
            2. code
                Code injection attacks differ from command injections because additional malicious code is added to an existing script or application. Then once that compromised script or application executes, the additional code will execute as well.
            3. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
                HTML injection is effectively a reflected XSS event, but instead of using JavaScript or other code, it plants custom HTML statements. 
            4. file injection
                File injection attempts to deposit a file on a target system. This can be attempted using a variety of techniques.
